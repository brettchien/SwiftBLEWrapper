This project is root from [PyBLEWrapper](https://github.com/brettchien/PyBLEWrapper) and then a similar version for swift is created.

During the development phase, another excellent project is also working on similar topic, [BlueCap](https://github.com/troystribling/BlueCap). BlueCap does inspire me in several design decisions including the future usage.
